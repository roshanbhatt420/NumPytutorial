## Overview
This contains simple exercises and examples I completed as part of a NumPy tutorial. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python, and this tutorial helped me understand its basic concepts and functionalities.

## Features
- Basics of NumPy arrays and their operations
- Array indexing and slicing
- operations with NumPy with the univeersal function
- Working with multi-dimensional arrays


## Installation
To run the code in this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the NumPy library. You can install NumPy using pip:
